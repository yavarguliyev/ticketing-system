# Transaction Isolation Levels

Transaction isolation is a fundamental concept in database systems that determines how and when changes made by one transaction are visible to other concurrent transactions. This document provides an overview of the different isolation levels, their characteristics, and trade-offs specific to our ticketing system.

## Understanding Isolation Levels

The SQL standard defines four isolation levels, each providing different guarantees regarding the phenomena that can occur during concurrent transaction execution:

### READ UNCOMMITTED

The lowest isolation level. A transaction can read changes made by other transactions that have not yet been committed.

- **Anomalies Permitted**: Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads
- **Performance**: Highest concurrency, lowest overhead
- **Use Cases**: When absolute data consistency is not critical and you need maximum throughput
- **In Ticketing System**: Not recommended for ticket booking as it could lead to selling more tickets than available

### READ COMMITTED

A transaction can only read changes made by other transactions that have been committed. It prevents dirty reads but still allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.

- **Anomalies Prevented**: Dirty reads
- **Anomalies Permitted**: Non-repeatable reads, phantom reads
- **Performance**: Good concurrency with reasonable consistency
- **Use Cases**: General-purpose operations where dirty reads must be avoided
- **In Ticketing System**: Acceptable for read operations like checking ticket availability, but not ideal for booking operations

### REPEATABLE READ

Ensures that if a transaction reads a row once, it will get the same data if it reads the same row again, even if other transactions modify the data. However, it still allows phantom reads.

- **Anomalies Prevented**: Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads
- **Anomalies Permitted**: Phantom reads
- **Performance**: Moderate concurrency with good consistency
- **Use Cases**: When consistent repeated reads are required within a transaction
- **In Ticketing System**: Good for operations that read the same tickets multiple times

### SERIALIZABLE

The highest isolation level. Transactions are completely isolated from each other, as if they were executed sequentially (one after another).

- **Anomalies Prevented**: Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads
- **Performance**: Lowest concurrency, highest overhead
- **Use Cases**: Financial transactions, critical operations where data consistency is paramount
- **In Ticketing System**: Ideal for ticket booking to prevent overselling

## Concurrency Anomalies

### Dirty Read

A transaction reads data that has been modified by another transaction that has not yet been committed. If the other transaction is rolled back, the first transaction has read invalid data.

**Example in Ticketing System**:

- Transaction A modifies a ticket quantity from 10 to 8
- Transaction B reads the ticket quantity as 8 before Transaction A commits
- If Transaction A rolls back, Transaction B has read an invalid value

### Non-repeatable Read

A transaction reads the same row twice but gets different data each time because another transaction has modified the data between reads.

**Example in Ticketing System**:

- Transaction A reads a ticket quantity as 10
- Transaction B modifies the ticket quantity to 8 and commits
- Transaction A reads the same ticket again and gets 8, which is inconsistent with its first read

### Phantom Read

A transaction executes a query that returns a set of rows, and then another transaction inserts new rows that would satisfy the query. If the first transaction runs the same query again, it will see the new rows ("phantoms").

**Example in Ticketing System**:

- Transaction A queries all tickets with price < $100 and gets 5 results
- Transaction B creates a new ticket with price $80 and commits
- If Transaction A runs the same query again, it will get 6 results

## Isolation Level Implementation in Our System

In our ticketing system, we've implemented different isolation levels for different operations:

1. **Ticket Booking (Pessimistic Locking)**: Uses SERIALIZABLE isolation level with pessimistic locking to prevent concurrent modifications and ensure consistency.

2. **Ticket Booking (Optimistic Concurrency)**: Uses READ COMMITTED isolation level with version tracking to detect conflicts and handle them with retries.

3. **Ticket Availability Check**: Uses REPEATABLE READ isolation level to ensure consistent reads during availability checks.

## Trade-offs and Considerations

### Performance vs. Consistency

Higher isolation levels provide better consistency but at the cost of reduced concurrency and performance. Choose the appropriate level based on the requirements of each operation.

### Deadlocks

Higher isolation levels increase the chance of deadlocks, especially with pessimistic locking. Our system includes deadlock detection and handling mechanisms.

### Lock Timeouts

Setting appropriate lock timeouts is crucial, especially at higher isolation levels where locks are held for longer. Our system is configured with timeout settings to prevent indefinite waiting.

### Retry Mechanisms

For optimistic concurrency control, retry mechanisms help handle version conflicts. Our system includes configurable retry options with exponential backoff.

## Best Practices

1. **Use the Least Restrictive Level**: Choose the lowest isolation level that meets your consistency requirements.

2. **Keep Transactions Short**: Long-running transactions increase the chance of conflicts and reduce concurrency.

3. **Consider Read vs. Write Operations**: Use different isolation levels for read-only vs. read-write operations.

4. **Monitor Lock Contention**: Watch for signs of lock contention and adjust isolation levels or application logic accordingly.

5. **Test Under Concurrent Load**: Thoroughly test your application under concurrent load to identify potential issues.

## Conclusion

Understanding transaction isolation levels is crucial for building reliable and performant database applications. In our ticketing system, we use different isolation levels for different operations to balance consistency and performance requirements.

By carefully choosing the appropriate isolation level for each operation and implementing proper locking strategies, we can ensure data consistency while maintaining good performance under concurrent load.
